      <h1>Welcome to ADHD Support Group</h1>
      <p>
        Everybody can have difficulty sitting still, paying attention or
        controlling impulsive behavior once in a while. For some people,
        however, the problems are so pervasive and persistent that they
        interfere with every aspect of their life: home, academic, social and
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental
        disorder affecting 11 percent of school-age children. Symptoms continue
        into adulthood in more than three-quarters of cases. ADHD is
        characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention,
        impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals with ADHD can be very successful in life. However, without
        identification and proper treatment, ADHD may have serious consequences,
        including school failure, family stress and disruption, depression,
        problems with relationships, substance abuse, delinquency, accidental
        injuries and job failure. Early identification and treatment are
        extremely important.
      </p>

      <h3>ADHD Predominantly Inattentive Presentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes
        </li>
        <li>Has difficulty sustaining attention</li>
        <li>Does not appear to listen</li>
        <li>Struggles to follow through with instructions</li>
        <li>Has difficulty with organization</li>
        <li>Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort</li>
        <li>Loses things</li>
        <li>Is easily distracted</li>
        <li>Is forgetful in daily activities</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ADHD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in chair</li>
        <li>Has difficulty remaining seated</li>
        <li>
          Runs about or climbs excessively in children; extreme restlessness in
          adults
        </li>
        <li>Difficulty engaging in activities quietly</li>
        <li>
          Acts as if driven by a motor; adults will often feel inside as if they
          are driven by a motor
        </li>
        <li>Talks excessively</li>
        <li>Blurts out answers before questions have been completed</li>
        <li>Difficulty waiting or taking turns</li>
        <li>Interrupts or intrudes upon others</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>ADHD Combined Presentation</h3>
      <p>
        The individual meets the criteria for both inattention and
        hyperactive-impulsive ADHD presentations. These symptoms can change over
        time, so children may fit different presentations as they get older.
      </p>

      <h3>Confusing Labels for ADHD</h3>
      <p>
        In 1994, the name of the disorder was changed in a way that is confusing
        for many people. Since that time all forms of attention deficit disorder
        are officially called “Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,”
        regardless of whether the individual has symptoms of hyperactivity or
        not. Even though these are the official labels, a lot of professionals
        and lay people still use both terms: ADD and ADHD.
      </p>

      <h3>Severity of Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        Clinicians can designate the severity of ADHD as “mild,” “moderate,” or
        “severe” under the criteria in the DSM-5.
      </p>

      <h3>ADHD Throughout the Lifespan</h3>
      <p>
        Children with ADHD often experience delays in independent functioning
        and may behave younger than their peers. Many children affected by ADHD
        can also have mild delays in language, motor skills, or social
        development that are not part of ADHD but often co-occur.
      </p>

      <h3>Co-occurring Disorders</h3>
      <p>
        More than two-thirds of children with ADHD have at least one other
        co-existing condition, such as anxiety, depression, or learning
        disabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Causes</h3>
      <p>
        Despite multiple studies, researchers have yet to determine the exact
        causes of ADHD. However, scientists have discovered a strong genetic
        link since ADHD can run in families.
